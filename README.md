<small> - If it is not divisible by 4, then it's not a leap year. </small>
<small> - If it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, then it is a leap year. </small>
<small> - If it is divisible by 100 but not by 400, then it's not a leap year. </small>
<small> - And finally, if it is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year. </small>
