# is it leap-year or not?

# The function works by checking if the year is divisible by 4, 100, and 400. 
# If it is not divisible by 4, then it's not a leap year. 
# If it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, then it is a leap year. 
# If it is divisible by 100 but not by 400, then it's not a leap year. 
#  And finally, if it is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.
